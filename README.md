# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple Task Manager/Work Day Scheduler that will run in the browser and dynamically update using JQUERY. I used Moment.js to handle the date and time in my code, as well as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Usage
The user inputs a task into a designanted time slot. The code then saves the info to local storage, and will keep all the inputs locally if the page is refreshed. This app can be used by anyone trying to work on time management or appointment setting.
